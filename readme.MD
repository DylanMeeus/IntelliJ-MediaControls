Media Controls for IntelliJ
====

This adds a Media entry in the IntelliJ IDEA toolbar. 
From this entry, you have the following options:

* Play / Pause
* Prev / Next 
* Lower / Raise volume
* Mute / Unmute

At the moment this only works on Linux based systems, and xdotool must be installed!

For debian based systems: `sudo apt-get install xdotool`.
